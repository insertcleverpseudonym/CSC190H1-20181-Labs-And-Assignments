Note: It is an academic offense to plagiarise the solutions of others and present them as your own. This code is publically visible and will be found in internet searches, so submitting these labs for grades is a *BAD* idea. You have been explicitly and sufficiently warned, and the author bears no responsibility of the consequences of the foolishness of any reader. The code in this repository is strictly for educational, self-instructional use.
