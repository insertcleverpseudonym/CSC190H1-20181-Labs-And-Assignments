Descriptions of each lab are provided in the corresponding files as docstrings, but here's an index by topic.

* Lab 1: Stacks, Queues, Building a paranthesis checker.
* Lab 2: k-ary Trees, Binary Trees, converting between both of these.
* Lab 3: Binary Search Trees
* Lab 4: Heaps, Hash Tables
* Lab 5: Graphs
* Lab 6: Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator (pRNG), Bitwise Operations
* Lab 7: Function Pointers, Parametrized BubbleSort, HeapSort
* Lab 8: In-place HeapSort, SelectionSort
* Lab 9: QuickSort, Towers of Hanoi

All of the python labs have been done in Python 2.7.2, so modify them accordingly if you wish to use other versions.
For the C labs, GCC was used for compiling, with a pedantic flag. For memory leak checking, I used valgrind.

Note: It is an academic offense to plagiarise the solutions of others and present them as your own. This code is publically visible and will be found in internet searches, so submitting these labs for grades is a *BAD* idea. You have been explicitly and sufficiently warned, and the author bears no responsibility of the consequences of the foolishness of any reader. The code in this repository is strictly for educational, self-instructional use.
